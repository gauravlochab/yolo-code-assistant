# YOLO Code Assistant Documentation

## Screenshots

To add the demo screenshots to the main README:

1. Save your Gradio interface screenshots in this directory as:
   - `demo-screenshot.png` (or `.jpg`)
   
2. The main README.md already references `docs/demo-screenshot.png`

3. You can add multiple screenshots if needed:
   - `demo-screenshot-1.png` - Export to ONNX example
   - `demo-screenshot-2.png` - Model evaluation example

The screenshots show the YOLO Code Assistant successfully answering questions about:
- How to export YOLO models to ONNX format
- How to evaluate YOLOv5 model performance

These demonstrate the RAG system retrieving relevant code and generating helpful responses.
